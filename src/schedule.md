The conference will follow a similar format to previous years:

*   Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday will be **talks and workshops**.
    We run multiple tracks in parallel, and everyone has a free choice of which sessions they attend.

*   Wednesday will be a **collaborative working day** (sometimes called a [code sprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#Code_sprints)).
    People work together on projects of their choice, such as open-source libraries and applications.

We will announce more details of the schedule, and how to submit proposals, closer to the event.
