The conference is being held in [Cardiff City Hall](https://www.cardiffcityhall.com/), the same venue we have used for several years.

## Accessibility

City Hall has two levels -- a ground floor and a first floor -- and we use both for the conference.
The majority of talks and workshops take place on the first floor.
There is step-free access to most of the building:

*   There is a wheelchair lift from street level to the ground floor
*   There is a lift from the ground floor to the first floor
*   There are steps to access the Council Chamber, which we use as our Quiet Room

There are accessible toilets on the ground floor.

We can provide parking at the venue for attendees with access needs -- if this is something you need, please [contact us](/contact/).
